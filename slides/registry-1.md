##### Image registries (1)
* Docker images are stored and distributed via *registries*
* A docker registry ~ git/svn server: contains images subdivided into repositories
* [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) ~ GitHub
  * [Official repositories](https://hub.docker.com/explore/)
  * Create your own *public* repositories in Dockerhub

note:
    The Docker Book: a very good book to get up and running quickly with docker
