###  General Information
#### Definition
* Docker is a popular implementation of [Operating-system-level virtualization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating-system-level_virtualization) aka Containerization
* Net result: user-space instance (aka *container*) has look and feel of a real server
* Why *containerization*?
  * (Almost) the same isolation guarantees btw. server processes
  * More resource efficient as opposed to classic *hardware* virtualization




note:
- The container idea is already around for a while. Other implementations, docker is the most successful one.
- Operating-system-level virtualization: a form of `server virtualization` where the OS kernel is allowing multiple user-space instances instead of one. 
- Net result: this user-space instance (aka `container`) has the look and feel of a real server from a user perspective.
