##### Installation: Linux only (2)?
* [Docker Machine](https://www.docker.com/docker-machine): a more recent and more general solution of running Docker hosts on:
  * your own machine: replaces boot2docker
  * inside your own datacenter (e.g. equinix)
  * on a cloud provider (AWS)
* Docker machine workflow
  * provisions the hosts
  * installs Docker Engine on them
  * configures the Docker client to talk to the Docker Engines.

note:
    The Docker Book: a very good book to get up and running quickly with docker
