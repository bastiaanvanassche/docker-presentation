#####Managing expectations

  * This is a brief introduction to Docker; I will not touch upon the replacement/improvement of the current way of deploying software (configuration-maps) because:
    * It's impossible to speak about this in an introductory Docker talk
    * I haven't found the time to look into it myself.
  * I'm not a system engineer nor a docker expert: I just want to point out that Docker is a very important technology worth looking into.
